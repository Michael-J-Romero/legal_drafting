### DECLARATION OF MICHAEL JAMES ROMERO IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDER SHORTENING TIME

I, Michael James Romero, declare:

1.  **Identity.** I am the Plaintiff in this action, appearing in pro per. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated herein and could competently testify to them.

2.  **Underlying Motion on file and set.** I filed Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition. The Motion is currently set for hearing on **February 11, 2026, at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12**. A true and correct copy of the filed Notice of Motion page reflecting that setting is attached as Exhibit C.

3.  **Deposition notice and service.** I duly noticed Defendant Megan Nicole Bentley's deposition and later served an amended notice accommodating scheduling and logistics. True and correct copies of the most recent Amended Notice of Deposition and proof(s) of service are attached as Exhibit B.

4.  **Nonappearance.** Defendant did not appear for her properly noticed deposition. A true and correct copy of the reporter's **Certificate of Nonappearance** is attached as Exhibit A.

5.  **Discovery cutoff and trial setting.** The general discovery cutoff elapsed on **October 22, 2025**. Trial is set for **July 13, 2026**.

6.  **Need for shortened time; prejudice absent relief.** If the Motion is heard on February 11, 2026, there will be insufficient time to complete and meaningfully use Defendant's deposition for expert work, motion practice, and trial preparation. Monetary sanctions, if any, cannot cure the lost preparation time. A shortened hearing date and condensed briefing schedule are necessary so the Court can address the outstanding party deposition in time for its orderly use before trial.

7.  **Exhibits attached to this declaration.** I attach the following true and correct copies:

    -   Exhibit A: Certificate of Nonappearance (reporter);
    -   Exhibit B: Most recent Amended Notice of Defendant's Deposition with proof(s) of service;
    -   Exhibit C: Filed Notice of Motion to Compel (first page showing the February 11, 2026 hearing).

8.  **Incorporation by reference.** I incorporate by reference the exhibits filed with my Declaration in support of the Motion to Compel (Exhibits A--G), including the original notice and amended notice, meet-and-confer emails, Certificate of Nonappearance, and reporting service records.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on **November 12, 2025**, at **Los Angeles, California**.
