### EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDER SHORTENING TIME ON PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT’S DEPOSITION; AND FOR CONDENSED BRIEFING SCHEDULE

- **Ex Parte Hearing:** Thursday, November 13, 2025, 9:00 a.m., Dept. R12
- **Underlying Motion Hearing (current):** February 11, 2026, 9:00 a.m., Dept. R12
- **Trial Date:** July 13, 2026
- **Discovery Cutoff:** October 22, 2025

TO THE COURT, THE CLERK, AND ALL PARTIES AND THEIR COUNSEL:

### I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Michael James Romero applies ex parte for limited scheduling relief only—an **Order Shortening Time** on Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition and a **condensed briefing schedule**. Plaintiff does not seek merits relief, sanctions, or any determination on discovery at the ex parte hearing.

### II. RELIEF REQUESTED

1. Advance the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition from February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12 to the earliest date convenient for the Court.
2. Set a condensed briefing schedule on that Motion: Opposition due five (5) court days before the advanced hearing date; Reply due two (2) court days before.
3. Confirm the merits of the Motion (including any request for sanctions or leave after cutoff) will be heard and decided only at the advanced noticed-motion hearing, not at this ex parte appearance.

### III. GROUNDS

- CRC 3.1200–3.1207; CRC 3.1300(b); CCP § 1005(b). **Good cause** exists because Defendant failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition; the general discovery cutoff has elapsed; trial is firmly set; and the Motion’s current hearing date is too late to allow orderly completion and use of the party deposition in pretrial preparation.
- Plaintiff seeks purely scheduling relief to avoid prejudice and to preserve a fair opportunity to take and use Defendant’s deposition before trial-related deadlines.

### IV. CRC 3.1202 REQUIRED DISCLOSURES

- **Identification of Opposing Counsel.** Defendant Megan Nicole Bentley is represented by:
Randal P. Hannah, Esq., Law Office of Randal P. Hannah, 489 N. Central Ave., Suite A, Upland, CA 91786; rhannah@rphannahlaw.com; (909) 608‑1220.
- **Prior Ex Parte Applications.** Plaintiff has not previously sought similar scheduling relief ex parte in this action.
- **Factual Showing / Supporting Declarations.** The accompanying declarations provide the affirmative factual showing required by CRC 3.1202(c) and attach the following minimal exhibits:
  - **Exhibit A:** Certificate of Nonappearance (reporter).
  - **Exhibit B:** Most recent Amended Notice of Defendant’s Deposition with proof(s) of service.
  - **Exhibit C:** Filed Notice of Motion to Compel (first page showing Feb. 11, 2026 hearing).
  - **Exhibit D:** Written ex parte notice email(s) to opposing counsel (and any written response).

### V. NOTICE

Plaintiff provided ex parte notice more than one court day in advance by email to defense counsel with the date, time, department, and nature of the relief; opposition status is presently unknown. Plaintiff will e‑file the ex parte papers and serve defense counsel pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure, the California Rules of Court, and applicable local rules.

### VI. PROCEDURAL POSTURE

Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition is on file and presently set for February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12. Discovery closed on October 22, 2025; trial is set for July 13, 2026. The requested scheduling order is necessary so the Motion can be heard early enough for the parties to complete and use Defendant’s deposition in a meaningful way before trial.

### VII. PRAYER

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Advance the hearing on the Motion to Compel to the earliest date convenient for the Court;
2. Set Opposition due five (5) court days and Reply due two (2) court days before the advanced hearing date; and
3. Grant such other and further scheduling relief as the Court deems just and proper.
