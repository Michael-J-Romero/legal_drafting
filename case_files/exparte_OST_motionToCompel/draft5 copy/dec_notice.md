### DECLARATION OF MICHAEL JAMES ROMERO REGARDING EX PARTE NOTICE

I, Michael James Romero, declare:

1.  **Identity and purpose.** I am the Plaintiff in this action, appearing in pro per. I make this declaration to describe the notice I gave of my Ex Parte Application for Order Shortening Time and for a condensed briefing schedule.

2.  **Ex parte hearing information.** The ex parte application is set for hearing on Thursday, November 13, 2025, at 9:00 a.m., in Department R12 of the Superior Court of California, County of San Bernardino, Rancho Cucamonga District, located at 8303 Haven Avenue, Rancho Cucamonga, California 91730.

3.  **Nature of relief sought ex parte.** The ex parte application seeks limited scheduling relief only: an Order Shortening Time on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition and a condensed briefing schedule. The merits of the Motion, including any request for sanctions or limited leave after the discovery cutoff, will be heard and decided only at the advanced noticed‑motion hearing, not at the ex parte appearance.

4.  **Opposing counsel information.** Defendant Megan Nicole Bentley is represented by:
    - Randal P. Hannah, Esq., Law Office of Randal P. Hannah, 489 N. Central Ave., Suite A, Upland, CA 91786; Email: [rhannah@rphannahlaw.com](https://platform.openai.com/chat/edit?models=gpt-5); Telephone: (909) 608‑1220.

5.  **When and how I gave notice.** On Monday, November 10, 2025, at approximately 2:35 p.m. Pacific Time, I provided ex parte notice by email to Mr. Hannah at [rhannah@rphannahlaw.com](https://platform.openai.com/chat/edit?models=gpt-5). This notice was provided more than one court day before the ex parte hearing.

6.  **What I told opposing counsel.** In that email, I advised defense counsel of:
    - the date, time, and department of the ex parte hearing (Nov. 13, 2025, 9:00 a.m., Dept. R12);
    - the nature of the relief requested (order shortening time and condensed briefing schedule on the Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition);
    - the grounds for the request (missed party deposition; discovery cutoff has passed; current hearing date of Feb. 11, 2026; and a firm July 13, 2026 trial setting); and
    - that I am not asking the Court to decide the merits or impose sanctions ex parte, only scheduling.

7.  **Opportunity to respond and opposition status.** I advised defense counsel that the Court may proceed with the ex parte application whether or not Defendant appears, and I provided a reasonable opportunity for counsel to indicate whether he intended to appear or oppose. As of 8:00 p.m. on November 12, 2025, I had not received any response and therefore do not know whether Defendant intends to oppose.

8.  **Attachment.** True and correct copies of my written ex parte notice email(s) (and any written response, if any) are attached as Exhibit D.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on **November 12, 2025**, at **Los Angeles, California**.
