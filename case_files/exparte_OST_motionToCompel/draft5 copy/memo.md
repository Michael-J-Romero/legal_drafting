### PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDER SHORTENING TIME AND FOR CONDENSED BRIEFING SCHEDULE

- **Ex Parte Hearing:** Thursday, November 13, 2025, 9:00 a.m., Dept. R12
- **Underlying Motion Hearing (current):** February 11, 2026, 9:00 a.m., Dept. R12
- **Trial Date:** July 13, 2026
- **Discovery Cutoff:** October 22, 2025

### I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff seeks limited scheduling relief only: an **Order Shortening Time** on Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition and a modest, fair **briefing schedule**. The underlying Motion is currently set for **February 11, 2026**—after the discovery cutoff and close to the **July 13, 2026** trial date—risking prejudice if Defendant’s deposition cannot be completed and used in time. Plaintiff does not ask the Court to decide the merits or impose sanctions at the ex parte hearing; all merits issues remain for the advanced noticed-motion hearing.

### II. LEGAL STANDARD

- **Ex parte applications:** California Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1200–3.1207. The applicant must show, by declaration with competent evidence, irreparable harm, immediate danger, or another statutory basis for ex parte relief, and must provide reasonable notice. CRC 3.1202(c), 3.1203–3.1204.
- **Orders shortening time:** The Court may, for good cause, prescribe a shorter time for the hearing and briefing of motions. Code Civ. Proc. § 1005(b); CRC 3.1300(b).

### III. ARGUMENT

#### A. Plaintiff satisfies the ex parte standard: irreparable harm and no adequate remedy via regular noticed-motion timing.

Defendant failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition. Fact discovery has closed, and the Motion’s current hearing date does not allow sufficient time to complete and meaningfully use Defendant’s deposition for expert work, motion practice, and trial preparation. Monetary sanctions alone cannot cure the lost preparation time. The supporting declarations and exhibits establish these facts and the risk of prejudice, meeting CRC 3.1202(c).

#### B. Good cause exists to shorten time and set a condensed briefing schedule.

Good cause exists because:

- A missed party deposition remains outstanding despite proper notice;
- Discovery is closed and trial is firm; and
- The current hearing date is too late to allow orderly use of the testimony.

A condensed schedule—Opposition due five court days before the advanced hearing and Reply due two court days before—preserves due process while enabling timely resolution.

#### C. The requested relief is limited, fair, and respects the Court’s discretion.

Plaintiff requests only scheduling relief. The merits (including any sanctions or limited leave after cutoff) will be decided at the advanced noticed-motion hearing, not ex parte. This approach balances the need for speed with fairness to both parties.

### IV. CONCLUSION

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

1. Advance the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel to the earliest date convenient for the Court;
2. Set Opposition due five (5) court days and Reply due two (2) court days before the advanced hearing date; and
3. Grant such other and further scheduling relief as the Court deems just and proper.
