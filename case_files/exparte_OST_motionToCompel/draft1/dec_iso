DECLARATION OF MICHAEL JAMES ROMERO
-----------------------------------

### IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDER SHORTENING TIME

I, **Michael James Romero**, declare:

1.  **Identity and Capacity.** I am the Plaintiff in this action, appearing in pro per. I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth herein and, if called as a witness, could and would competently testify thereto.

2.  **Underlying Motion on File and Set.** On **\[date filed\]**, I filed **Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Cutoff** (the "Motion"). The clerk set the hearing for **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12**. A true and correct copy of the **Notice of Motion** and **reservation/setting** is attached as **Exhibit D**.

3.  **Deposition Notice and Amendments.** I duly noticed Defendant **Megan Nicole Bentley's** deposition for **\[original date\]** at **\[time\]**, at **\[location\]**. After receiving written objections, I served an amended notice that cured the objections (including providing a physical address and confirming remote oath administration) and re-set the deposition for **\[reset date\]**. True and correct copies of the notice(s) and proof(s) of service are attached as **Exhibit B**.

4.  **Nonappearance / Certificate of Nonappearance.** Defendant did not appear for her deposition on **\[reset date\]** and did not seek or obtain any protective order. A certified shorthand reporter issued a **Certificate of Nonappearance**, and I incurred **$\[amount\]** in reporter fees and related costs. A true and correct copy of the Certificate is attached as **Exhibit A**.

5.  **Meet and Confer Efforts.** Following the nonappearance, I met and conferred with Defendant (and/or her counsel) via **\[email/phone/text\]** on **\[dates\]** in an effort to promptly reschedule the deposition without court intervention. Those efforts were unsuccessful. True and correct copies of my correspondence are attached as **Exhibit C**.

6.  **Discovery Status and Trial Setting.** The **discovery cutoff has passed** on **\[date\]**. Trial is presently set for **July 13, 2026**. As a party-opponent, Defendant's sworn testimony is **central** to the claims and defenses and necessary for orderly completion of pretrial tasks (including deposition-based impeachment, witness and exhibit designations, and trial readiness). Waiting until **February 11, 2026** to hear the Motion will **materially compress** the time to obtain and use Defendant's testimony.

7.  **Good Cause for Shortened Time.** I am **not** seeking merits relief at the ex parte appearance. I seek **only an Order Shortening Time** so that the already-filed Motion can be heard on the Court's earliest available date, with a fair but condensed schedule (Opposition due **5 court days** before; Reply due **2 court days** before). Good cause exists because: (a) Defendant failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition and did not pursue a protective order; (b) discovery is closed; (c) the party deposition is pivotal to trial preparation; and (d) the current three-month delay to hearing risks prejudice that an earlier hearing would avoid.

8.  **Ex Parte Notice Given (CRC 3.1203/3.1204).** On **\[date\]** at **\[time\]**, I provided ex parte notice to **\[name/email/phone of counsel or party\]** stating that I would appear **ex parte** in **Dept. R12** on **\[hearing date\] at \[time\]** to request an **Order Shortening Time** on the Motion and a condensed briefing schedule; that I would **not** seek a merits ruling ex parte; and asking whether opposition is anticipated. **\[He/She/They\]** responded **\[state response, or "no response as of the time of filing"\]**. A true and correct copy of my notice (and any response) is attached as **Exhibit E**.

9.  **Proposed Schedule.** If the Court grants this Application, I respectfully propose: (a) set the Motion for hearing on **\[proposed date 2--3 weeks out\]**; (b) require any Opposition **5 court days** before hearing; (c) allow a Reply **2 court days** before hearing; and (d) permit electronic service where authorized.

10.  **Attachments Incorporated.** This declaration incorporates by reference the papers already on file with the Court in support of the Motion and attaches true and correct copies of Exhibits A--E as described above, lodged concurrently.

11.  **Reservation of Merits for Advanced Hearing.** All merits issues---compelling attendance, setting a firm deposition date, monetary sanctions under **CCP § 2025.450**, and limited leave under **CCP § 2024.050**---are reserved for the advanced hearing on the Motion.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.
