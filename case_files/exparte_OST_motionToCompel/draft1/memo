## PLAINTIFF’S MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES

### IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDER SHORTENING TIME

### I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff seeks a narrow scheduling order: an **Order Shortening Time (OST)** to advance the hearing on Plaintiff’s already‑filed **Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition; for Monetary Sanctions; and for Limited Post‑Cutoff Leave**, and to set a short, fair briefing schedule. Plaintiff does **not** seek a merits ruling at the ex parte appearance. Good cause exists to accelerate the hearing because Defendant failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition without seeking a protective order, the discovery window has closed, and the deposition is central to case preparation.

### II. RELEVANT BACKGROUND

1. **Missed deposition / no protective order.** Plaintiff duly noticed Defendant’s deposition, cured objections with an amended notice, and appeared with a certified shorthand reporter. Defendant did not appear and did not obtain a protective order. A Certificate of Nonappearance issued and Plaintiff incurred reporter charges.
2. **Motion filed and set three months out.** Plaintiff filed the Motion to Compel; the clerk set hearing for **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. (Dept. R12)**.
3. **Discovery closed; trial set.** Fact discovery has closed; trial is set for **July 13, 2026**. A party‑opponent deposition is pivotal to preparation for trial and any dispositive or evidentiary motions.
4. **Meet‑and‑confer.** Plaintiff attempted in good faith to reset the deposition without court intervention; efforts were unsuccessful.

### III. LEGAL STANDARD

**A. Authority to shorten time.** A court may, for good cause, shorten time for the hearing of a motion. (Cal. Rules of Court, **rule 3.1300(b)**; Code Civ. Proc., **§ 1005(b)**.)

**B. Ex parte requirements.** Ex parte applications are governed by Cal. Rules of Court, **rules 3.1200–3.1207**. The application must show, by declaration, why the matter is appropriately handled ex parte, and that notice compliant with rule **3.1203** (timing) and rule **3.1204** (content) was given, or explain why it could not be. Rule **3.1202(c)** requires a showing of irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory basis for the relief requested. Courts commonly use ex parte to set schedules (e.g., shorten time) while reserving merits for the noticed hearing.

### IV. ARGUMENT

**A. Good cause exists to shorten time so the Motion can be heard promptly with fair briefing.**

1. **Defendant’s nonappearance warrants prompt adjudication.** Defendant’s failure to appear at a properly noticed deposition—without seeking a protective order—supports prompt court intervention to keep the case on track. The Motion seeks the standard relief contemplated by Code Civ. Proc., **§ 2025.450** (compelling attendance/testimony and monetary sanctions upon a grant).

2. **Discovery is closed and the deposition is central.** With discovery closed and trial approaching, months‑out hearing dates materially compress Plaintiff’s ability to obtain and use Defendant’s testimony for trial preparation and related deadlines. Shortening time mitigates that prejudice while preserving due process for opposition.

3. **The requested relief is narrow and preserves due process.** Plaintiff asks only for an OST and a modest condensed schedule—**Opposition 5 court days before** and **Reply 2 court days before**—a cadence commonly used on shortened time. This balances expedition with fairness and avoids deciding merits on an emergency basis.

**B. The merits will be decided at the advanced hearing; the Court retains full discretion.**

The ex parte request does not ask the Court to resolve the Motion now. The merits issues—compelling attendance, setting a firm deposition date, monetary sanctions under § 2025.450, and limited leave under **§ 2024.050**—are reserved for the advanced hearing, after orderly briefing on the condensed schedule the Court sets.

### V. REQUESTED ORDER / PROPOSED SCHEDULE

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Advance the hearing** on Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel to the Court’s earliest convenient date (approximately **2–3 weeks** from the ex parte appearance, or as the Court directs);
2. Set briefing as follows (or as the Court prefers): **Opposition due 5 court days before** hearing; **Reply due 2 court days before** hearing; service by electronic means where permitted; and
3. Grant such further scheduling directions as may be necessary to effectuate the advanced hearing.

### VI. CONCLUSION

Good cause exists to shorten time. Plaintiff respectfully requests an OST advancing the hearing on the Motion and a condensed briefing schedule as set forth above. The merits should be adjudicated at the advanced hearing.
