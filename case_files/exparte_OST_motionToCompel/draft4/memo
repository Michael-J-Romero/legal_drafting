PLAINTIFF'S MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
------------------------------------------------

### IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDER SHORTENING TIME

* * * *

### I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff seeks a narrow scheduling order: an **Order Shortening Time** on **Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Discovery Cutoff** (the “Motion”), and a **condensed but fair briefing schedule** on that Motion.

The request will be heard at an **ex parte hearing set for Thursday, November 13, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12**. The Motion itself is presently set for hearing on **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12**, nearly three months after the ex parte date, even though:

- Defendant failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition;
- The **general discovery cutoff passed on October 22, 2025**; and
- The case is set for a firm **jury trial on July 13, 2026**.

Plaintiff does **not** ask the Court to decide the merits of the Motion or to award sanctions at the ex parte hearing. Instead, he seeks **only**:

1. To advance the hearing on the already-filed Motion to the **earliest date convenient for the Court**; and  
2. To set a **short but fair briefing schedule** so that both sides can be heard on the Motion before trial preparation is irreparably prejudiced.

Good cause and the required showing of **irreparable harm / immediate danger and lack of an adequate remedy by regular noticed motion** are established in Plaintiff’s declarations. If the Motion is not heard on shortened time, Defendant’s missed deposition—occurring after a fully expired discovery cutoff—will severely impair Plaintiff’s ability to prepare for expert work, motion practice, and trial.

### II. RELEVANT BACKGROUND

1. **Missed deposition / no protective order.**  
   Plaintiff duly noticed Defendant **Megan Nicole Bentley’s** deposition, and after accommodating scheduling issues, served one or more amended deposition notices. Defendant failed to appear for her properly noticed deposition and did not obtain any protective order relieving her of the obligation to attend. A Certificate of Nonappearance issued, and Plaintiff incurred approximately **$500** in court reporter and related charges.

2. **Motion filed and set three months out.**  
   Plaintiff filed the Motion seeking: (a) an order compelling Defendant’s deposition under **Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450**; (b) monetary sanctions for the nonappearance; and (c) limited leave under **Code of Civil Procedure section 2024.050** to complete Defendant’s deposition after the discovery cutoff. The Motion is currently set for hearing on **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12**, nearly three months after the ex parte date.

3. **Discovery closed; trial set.**  
   Fact discovery closed on **October 22, 2025**. The Court has set a firm **jury trial date of July 13, 2026**. If the Motion is not heard until February 11, 2026, Plaintiff will have extremely limited time—if any—to (a) complete Defendant’s deposition, (b) incorporate Defendant’s testimony into expert discovery, (c) conduct follow-up discovery, and (d) prepare for trial and any dispositive or evidentiary motions.

4. **Meet-and-confer.**  
   After the nonappearance, Plaintiff attempted in good faith to meet and confer with Defendant’s counsel regarding Defendant’s failure to appear, rescheduling the deposition, and the costs incurred. Plaintiff’s efforts did not resolve the dispute or secure a new deposition date without court intervention, making the Motion necessary.

### III. LEGAL STANDARD

#### A. Ex parte applications

Ex parte applications in civil cases are governed by **California Rules of Court, rules 3.1200–3.1207**. Rule **3.1202(c)** requires that a party:

- “make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of **irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis** for granting relief ex parte.”

Rule **3.1203** requires that reasonable notice be given to all parties, unless the applicant shows that notice should not be required. Rule **3.1204** sets out the contents of a declaration regarding notice.

**San Bernardino Superior Court Local Rule 731** incorporates and applies these statewide ex parte standards in the personal injury context, and requires compliance with the California Rules of Court or an explanation of any exception.

#### B. Orders shortening time

**Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b)** provides that the Court may, for good cause, “prescribe a shorter time” for hearing motions than the ordinary notice period. **California Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(b)** complements section 1005(b) by authorizing courts to shorten time for notice and service of motions when appropriate.

Taken together, **section 1005(b)** and **rule 3.1300(b)** give the Court broad discretion to issue an **order shortening time** on a properly filed motion, including discovery motions, where good cause exists—particularly when the regular law-and-motion calendar would otherwise impair the fair resolution of the case.

### IV. ARGUMENT

#### A. Plaintiff satisfies the ex parte standard: irreparable harm / immediate danger and no adequate remedy via regular noticed motion.

Under **rule 3.1202(c)**, Plaintiff must show **irreparable harm, immediate danger, or another statutory basis** for ex parte relief, and that ordinary noticed-motion timing is inadequate. Plaintiff’s declaration satisfies that standard.

1. **Defendant’s nonappearance and outstanding deposition create serious trial prejudice.**  
   Defendant failed to appear for her properly noticed deposition and did not seek a protective order. As a result, Plaintiff still has no sworn deposition testimony from the opposing party. In a case set for a firm jury trial, the absence of the defendant’s testimony at this stage is not merely inconvenient; it directly impairs Plaintiff’s ability to prepare his case, test Defendant’s version of events, and evaluate settlement and trial strategy. That prejudice cannot be undone by a late deposition on the eve of trial.

2. **Discovery is closed, so delay cannot be cured by further discovery.**  
   The **general discovery cutoff passed on October 22, 2025**, while Defendant’s deposition remains outstanding. Without relief under **section 2024.050** and a timely ruling on the Motion, Plaintiff is effectively trapped: he must either proceed to trial without Defendant’s deposition or rely on an uncertain, compressed schedule after February 11, 2026. Because discovery is closed, Plaintiff cannot simply “do more discovery later” if the Motion is heard too late. That is classic **irreparable harm** in the discovery context.

3. **The current hearing date is too late to permit orderly use of Defendant’s testimony.**  
   The Motion is set for hearing on **February 11, 2026**, several months after the discovery cutoff and only months before the **July 13, 2026** trial date. If the Court waits until that date to hear the Motion:

   - The parties will have little time to schedule and complete Defendant’s deposition;  
   - Follow-up discovery or motions based on Defendant’s testimony may be impossible or severely compressed; and  
   - Plaintiff’s trial preparation will be significantly prejudiced.

   By contrast, advancing the hearing on the Motion to the **earliest date convenient for the Court** allows the Court to address the missed deposition in time for Defendant’s testimony to meaningfully inform expert work, motions in limine, and trial strategy.

4. **There is no adequate remedy via regular noticed motion timing.**  
   Leaving the Motion on the ordinary law and motion calendar—February 11, 2026—offers no adequate remedy. Monetary sanctions alone cannot restore lost preparation time or cure the strategic disadvantage of proceeding toward trial without the defendant’s sworn testimony. The harm is therefore **irreparable** within the meaning of rule 3.1202(c) unless the Motion is heard on shortened time.

Accordingly, Plaintiff has made the affirmative showing of **irreparable harm / immediate danger and lack of an adequate remedy** required for ex parte relief. The Court thus has full authority under **section 1005(b)** and **rule 3.1300(b)** to shorten time.

#### B. Good cause exists to shorten time so the Motion can be heard promptly with fair briefing.

Even apart from the ex parte overlay, **good cause** exists under **rule 3.1300(b)** and **Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b)** to shorten time on the Motion and set a condensed briefing schedule.

1. **Defendant’s nonappearance warrants prompt adjudication under section 2025.450.**  
   The Motion arises from a straightforward discovery violation: Defendant’s failure to appear for a duly noticed deposition without obtaining a protective order. **Section 2025.450** expressly authorizes the Court to compel attendance and testimony and to award sanctions in such circumstances. Prompt adjudication of the Motion ensures that:

   - The Court addresses the nonappearance while the events are recent; and  
   - Any compelled deposition goes forward early enough to be useful for trial and related motions.

2. **Discovery is closed and trial is approaching, amplifying the prejudice of delay.**  
   With discovery closed and trial set, each week of delay in resolving the Motion compresses Plaintiff’s remaining preparation time. Without shortened time, Plaintiff’s ability to:

   - Analyze Defendant’s testimony;  
   - Conduct any necessary follow-up; and  
   - Integrate the testimony into expert work and trial planning  

   will be seriously constrained. That is more than simple inconvenience; it is a concrete impact on Plaintiff’s ability to fairly present his case.

3. **The requested briefing schedule preserves due process.**  
   Plaintiff’s proposed schedule—Opposition due **five court days before** the advanced hearing date and Reply due **two court days before**—balances the need for speed with fairness. Both sides will have an opportunity to be heard, and Defendant will have a meaningful chance to oppose the Motion in writing. A modestly condensed schedule is common where the issues are limited and the relevant facts are already set out in declarations.

4. **The requested relief is limited to scheduling and respects the Court’s discretion.**  
   Plaintiff does not ask the Court to decide the Motion ex parte or to issue sanctions without notice and an opportunity to be heard. He only asks that:

   - The hearing on the **already-filed** Motion be advanced to the **earliest date convenient for the Court**; and  
   - A fair but shortened briefing schedule be set.

   The Court retains full discretion at the advanced hearing to grant, deny, or tailor relief under **sections 2025.450 and 2024.050**. The ex parte order would simply ensure that this decision is made in time to be meaningful.

* * * *

### V. CONCLUSION

Plaintiff has made the affirmative factual showing of **irreparable harm / immediate danger and lack of an adequate remedy by regular noticed motion**, as required by **California Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c)**. Defendant’s missed deposition, the expired discovery cutoff, the Motion’s distant hearing date, and the firm July 13, 2026 trial setting demonstrate that ordinary noticed-motion timing is inadequate.

For these reasons, and those set forth in Plaintiff’s declarations, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

1. **Grant an Order Shortening Time** advancing the hearing on Plaintiff’s Motion from **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12** to the **earliest date convenient for the Court**;

2. **Adopt a condensed briefing schedule** on the Motion, with Opposition due **five (5) court days** and Reply due **two (2) court days** before the advanced hearing date (or such other schedule as the Court deems just and proper); and

3. Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
