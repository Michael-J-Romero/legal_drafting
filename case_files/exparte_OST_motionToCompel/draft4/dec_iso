DECLARATION OF MICHAEL JAMES ROMERO
-----------------------------------

### IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDER SHORTENING TIME

I, **Michael James Romero**, declare:

1.  **Identity and Capacity.** I am the Plaintiff in this action. I make this declaration in support of my **Ex Parte Application for Order Shortening Time on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Discovery Cutoff; and for Condensed Briefing Schedule**. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration and, if called as a witness, could and would competently testify thereto.

2.  **Underlying Motion on File and Set.** I filed **Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Discovery Cutoff** (the "Motion"). The Motion is presently set for hearing on **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12**. A true and correct copy of the Notice of Motion and hearing setting is attached as **Exhibit D**.

3.  **Deposition Notice and Amendments.** I duly noticed Defendant **Megan Nicole Bentley’s** deposition in this case and served the deposition notice on Defendant’s counsel of record. After accommodating scheduling issues, I served one or more amended deposition notices rescheduling Defendant’s deposition. True and correct copies of the deposition notice(s), any amended notice(s), and proof(s) of service are attached as **Exhibit B**.

4.  **Nonappearance / Certificate of Nonappearance.** Defendant did not appear for her properly noticed deposition. No protective order was obtained relieving Defendant of the obligation to appear. The court reporter prepared a **Certificate of Nonappearance** reflecting Defendant’s failure to appear. I incurred approximately **$500** in court reporter and related charges for the missed deposition. A true and correct copy of the Certificate of Nonappearance is attached as **Exhibit A**.

5.  **Meet and Confer Efforts.** Following the nonappearance, I attempted in good faith to meet and confer with Defendant’s counsel regarding Defendant’s missed deposition and a new date for her deposition, as well as the costs I incurred as a result of the nonappearance. I sent correspondence to Defendant’s counsel explaining my position and requesting that Defendant appear for a properly rescheduled deposition and that my out-of-pocket expenses be addressed. True and correct copies of my meet and confer correspondence are attached as **Exhibit C**.

6.  **Discovery Status and Trial Setting.** The **discovery cutoff** in this matter was **October 22, 2025**. The case is set for **jury trial on July 13, 2026**. Because Defendant’s deposition has not yet been taken, and because the Motion is not presently set to be heard until **February 11, 2026**, leaving the Motion on the regular schedule will substantially compress or effectively eliminate the time available for me to (a) complete Defendant’s deposition; (b) use her testimony in expert discovery; (c) prepare and file pretrial motions; and (d) adequately prepare for the July 13, 2026 trial.

7.  **Good Cause for Shortened Time.** I am **not** seeking a ruling on the merits of the Motion or any sanctions at the ex parte hearing. I seek only an **order shortening time** and a **condensed briefing schedule** so that the already-filed Motion can be heard on an earlier date. Good cause exists because: (a) Defendant failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition and did not obtain a protective order; (b) the general discovery cutoff has passed while Defendant’s deposition remains outstanding; (c) the Motion is not set to be heard until February 11, 2026, which is too close to trial to allow orderly completion and use of Defendant’s deposition; and (d) without shortened time, I will suffer serious prejudice in preparing for expert discovery, pretrial motions, and trial. I understand that the Court has authority under the **California Rules of Court, including rules 3.1200–3.1207**, and under **Code of Civil Procedure section 1005(b)**, to prescribe shorter times for the hearing and briefing of motions where good cause is shown, and that **Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450** authorizes relief where a party fails to appear for a properly noticed deposition.

8.  **Ex Parte Notice (CRC 3.1203 / 3.1204).** I provided ex parte notice of this Application to Defendant’s counsel, **Randal P. Hannah, Esq.**, at his office in Upland, California, including by the contact methods customarily used in this case. In that notice, I advised counsel of: (a) the **date, time, and department** of the ex parte hearing; (b) the **relief requested** (an order shortening time on the Motion and a condensed briefing schedule); and (c) the **basis** for the request, including Defendant’s missed deposition, the discovery cutoff having passed, and the upcoming trial date. I also advised counsel that I was not seeking to have the Motion decided ex parte, but only to obtain scheduling relief. My separate **Declaration Regarding Ex Parte Notice** describes the date, time, manner, and content of my notice in more detail. True and correct copies of my written notice communications, and any written response, are attached as **Exhibit E**.

9.  **Proposed Schedule.** If the Court grants this Application, I respectfully propose that the Court: (a) advance the hearing on the Motion from **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12** to the **earliest date convenient for the Court**; (b) require that I promptly serve the Motion and the Court’s Order Shortening Time on Defendant’s counsel; (c) set a briefing schedule providing that any **Opposition** to the Motion be filed and served **five (5) court days before** the advanced hearing date and any **Reply** be filed and served **two (2) court days before** the advanced hearing date; and (d) permit electronic service of the Motion and any Opposition or Reply to the extent authorized by statute, rule, or agreement between the parties.

10. **Attachments Incorporated.** This declaration incorporates by reference and authenticates the following exhibits, which are true and correct copies of the documents described:

    a. **Exhibit A** – Certificate of Nonappearance regarding Defendant’s missed deposition;

    b. **Exhibit B** – Deposition notice(s), any amended notice(s), and proof(s) of service for Defendant’s deposition;

    c. **Exhibit C** – My meet and confer correspondence with Defendant’s counsel regarding Defendant’s nonappearance, rescheduling, and related issues;

    d. **Exhibit D** – Plaintiff’s Notice of Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition and hearing setting; and

    e. **Exhibit E** – My written ex parte notice to Defendant’s counsel regarding this Application (and any written response).

11. **Reservation of Merits for Advanced Hearing.** All issues concerning the **merits** of the Motion — including whether Defendant’s conduct warrants relief under **Code of Civil Procedure section 2025.450**, whether monetary sanctions should be awarded, and whether limited leave should be granted to complete Defendant’s deposition after the discovery cutoff — as well as any issues concerning the exact hearing date, briefing schedule, and service deadlines for the Motion, are reserved for the **advanced hearing** on the Motion. I understand that the Court will not decide the merits of the Motion or impose any sanctions at the ex parte hearing on this Application. My request is limited to scheduling relief in the form of an order shortening time and a condensed briefing schedule.
