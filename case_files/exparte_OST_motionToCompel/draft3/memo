PLAINTIFF'S MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
------------------------------------------------

### IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDER SHORTENING TIME

* * * *

### I. INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff seeks a narrow scheduling order: an **Order Shortening Time (OST)** to advance the hearing on Plaintiff's already-filed **Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; for Monetary Sanctions; and for Limited Post-Cutoff Leave** and to set a short, fair briefing schedule.

This request will be heard at an **ex parte hearing set for Thursday, November 13, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. in Department R12**. Plaintiff does **not** seek a merits ruling on the Motion at the ex parte appearance. The only relief requested ex parte is: (1) advancement of the hearing date and (2) a condensed, but fair, briefing schedule.

Good cause and the required showing of **irreparable harm / immediate danger** exist to accelerate the hearing because (a) Defendant failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition without seeking a protective order, (b) fact discovery has closed, and (c) as explained in Plaintiff's declaration, the delay in resolving discovery materially worsens ongoing harms relating to Plaintiff's **service-dog dependence, risk of skill deterioration, and evidence of neglect** that cannot be adequately addressed if the Motion is not heard until February 11, 2026.

* * * *

### II. RELEVANT BACKGROUND

1.  **Missed deposition / no protective order.** Plaintiff duly noticed Defendant's deposition, cured objections with an amended notice, and appeared with a certified shorthand reporter. Defendant did not appear and did not obtain a protective order. A Certificate of Nonappearance issued and Plaintiff incurred reporter charges.

2.  **Motion filed and set three months out.** Plaintiff filed the Motion to Compel; the clerk set hearing for **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. (Dept. R12)**, nearly three months after the ex parte date.

3.  **Discovery closed; trial set.** Fact discovery has closed; trial is set for **July 13, 2026**. A party-opponent deposition is pivotal to preparation for trial and any dispositive or evidentiary motions.

4.  **Meet-and-confer.** Plaintiff attempted in good faith to reset the deposition without court intervention; efforts were unsuccessful.

5.  **Ongoing harms detailed in declaration.** As set forth in Plaintiff's concurrently filed **Declaration in Support of Ex Parte Application**, Plaintiff:

    -   Relies on a trained service dog for daily functioning and safety;

    -   Faces **risk of deterioration of the dog's training and skills** because of ongoing instability and delay; and

    -   Possesses and is seeking discovery relevant to **neglect and mistreatment**, which becomes increasingly difficult to develop and present as time passes.

    These harms are not adequately remediable by a later monetary award or by simply "catching up" after a delayed hearing.

### III. LEGAL STANDARD

#### A. Ex parte applications and showing of irreparable harm

Ex parte applications in civil cases are governed by **California Rules of Court, rules 3.1200--3.1207**. A request for ex parte relief must be in writing and must include, among other things, (1) an application stating the relief requested, (2) a declaration making the factual showing required under rule 3.1202(c), (3) a declaration regarding notice under rule 3.1204, (4) a memorandum, and (5) a proposed order. [California Courts+1](https://courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index/three/rule3_1201?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Rule **3.1202(c)** requires that the applicant:

> "make an affirmative factual showing in a declaration containing competent testimony based on personal knowledge of **irreparable harm**, **immediate danger**, or any other **statutory basis** for granting relief ex parte." [California Courts+1](https://courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index/three/rule3_1202?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Rule **3.1203(a)** further requires that, absent exceptional circumstances, a party seeking ex parte relief **notify all parties no later than 10:00 a.m. the court day before** the ex parte appearance. [pacifica.org+1](https://pacifica.org/documents/lawsuit/Anderson%20Ex%20Parte%20Motion%20to%20Withdraw%20copy.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Rule **3.1204** prescribes the contents of the notice declaration, including the date, time, manner of notice, and the responses of the other side. [California Courts+1](https://courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index/three/rule3_1201?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**San Bernardino Superior Court Local Rule 731** incorporates and supplements these statewide requirements for ex parte applications, including notice obligations. [Trellis Law+3Trellis Law+3Trellis Law+3](https://trellis.law/doc/260361091/ex-parte-application-filed?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Plaintiff's **Declaration re Notice** describes compliance with rule 3.1203 and Local Rule 731 or explains any exception.

In addition, California courts possess inherent authority under **Code of Civil Procedure § 128** to control their proceedings and to amend and control their process and orders to conform to law and justice. [Justia Law+1](https://law.justia.com/codes/california/2007/ccp/128-129.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

#### B. Orders shortening time for noticed motions

The normal schedule for law-and-motion practice is governed by **Code of Civil Procedure § 1005**, which sets the standard notice and briefing deadlines. Section **1005(b)** expressly provides that:

> "The court, or a judge thereof, may prescribe a shorter time"

than the usual time for serving and filing motion and opposition papers. [FindLaw Codes+2Arnold & Peterson, LLP+2](https://codes.findlaw.com/ca/code-of-civil-procedure/ccp-sect-1005/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**California Rules of Court, rule 3.1300(b)** complements § 1005(b) by authorizing the court, on its own motion or on an **application for an order shortening time supported by a declaration showing good cause**, to prescribe shorter times for filing and service than those specified in § 1005. [California Courts+1](https://courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index/three/rule3_1300?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Taken together, **rule 3.1300(b)** and **§ 1005(b)** supply the authority for an OST, while **rule 3.1202(c)** and related ex parte rules govern the circumstances under which that relief may be sought and granted on an ex parte basis.

### IV. ARGUMENT

#### A. Plaintiff satisfies the ex parte standard: irreparable harm, immediate danger, and no adequate remedy via regular noticed timing.

Under rule **3.1202(c)**, Plaintiff must show **irreparable harm, immediate danger, or another statutory basis** if relief is not granted ex parte. [California Courts+1](https://courts.ca.gov/cms/rules/index/three/rule3_1202?utm_source=chatgpt.com) Plaintiff's declaration provides that showing:

1.  **Service-dog dependence and functional harm.** Plaintiff depends on a trained service dog for safety, daily functioning, and emotional stability. As explained in the declaration, the ongoing uncertainty and delay in resolving this litigation---and Defendant's refusal to sit for deposition---exacerbate Plaintiff's impairments and undermine the stability and support the service dog is supposed to provide. These day-to-day impacts are not fully compensable later and cannot be undone by a monetary sanction or a late deposition.

2.  **Risk of skill deterioration.** Service-dog training is a perishable skill set. Plaintiff's declaration explains that the dog's specialized training and responsiveness are already under strain due to disruption and ongoing stress. If the deposition remains delayed until **February 11, 2026**, the intervening months will likely worsen this deterioration. Once that deterioration occurs, it **cannot readily be restored**, even if Plaintiff ultimately prevails.

3.  **Neglect evidence becomes harder to develop and present over time.** The declaration describes evidence relevant to **neglect and mistreatment** that must be explored through Defendant's testimony. Memories fade, third-party witnesses become harder to locate, and contemporaneous impressions become more difficult to reconstruct as months pass. Denying OST and forcing Plaintiff to wait for a February hearing significantly impairs Plaintiff's ability to develop and present this evidence at trial.

4.  **Ordinary noticed motion timing is inadequate.** A standard § 1005 schedule---with a hearing not until February 11, 2026---would prolong the unresolved status of the deposition for nearly three additional months beyond the ex parte date. In the context of (a) Plaintiff's **ongoing service-dog-related harms**, (b) a **closed discovery window**, and (c) a **July 13, 2026 trial**, this delay is not merely inconvenient; it materially prejudices Plaintiff's ability to prepare and to stem ongoing harm. That is precisely the type of situation in which ex parte OST relief is contemplated. [ceb.com+1](https://www.ceb.com/when-and-how-to-shorten-time-for-discovery-in-california/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Accordingly, Plaintiff's declaration makes the affirmative showing required by **rule 3.1202(c)** and supports the exercise of the Court's authority under **§ 1005(b)** and **rule 3.1300(b)** to shorten time.

#### B. Good cause exists to shorten time so the Motion can be heard promptly with fair briefing.

Even apart from the ex parte overlay, **good cause** exists for an OST under **rule 3.1300(b)** and **CCP § 1005(b)**:

1.  **Defendant's nonappearance warrants prompt adjudication.** Defendant's failure to appear at a properly noticed deposition---without moving for a protective order---fits squarely within **§ 2025.450's** contemplated grounds for a motion to compel attendance, testimony, and sanctions. Prompt court intervention is necessary to ensure the deposition goes forward in time to be useful for trial and related motions.

2.  **Discovery is closed and trial is approaching.** With fact discovery closed and trial set for **July 13, 2026**, a February 11, 2026 hearing date pushes the deposition perilously close to pretrial deadlines. That compresses Plaintiff's ability to:

    -   Analyze Defendant's testimony;

    -   Conduct any necessary follow-up; and

    -   Prepare for trial and any dispositive or evidentiary motions.

    Shortening time mitigates this prejudice while still allowing Defendant an opportunity to oppose.

3.  **The requested schedule is modest and preserves due process.** Plaintiff proposes an advanced hearing on **Thursday, December 4, 2025 at 9:00 a.m., Dept. R12** (or the Court's earliest available date) with the following schedule:

    -   **Opposition due 5 court days before** the advanced hearing;

    -   **Reply due 2 court days before** the advanced hearing.

    This schedule is commonly used for OSTs and preserves a meaningful opportunity for Defendant to respond while preventing the significant prejudice that would result from waiting until February.

#### C. The ex parte request is narrowly procedural; the Court retains full discretion over the Motion's merits.

The ex parte application does **not** ask the Court to decide the underlying Motion now. Instead, it seeks only:

-   An **earlier hearing date**, and

-   A **condensed but fair briefing schedule**.

The merits---whether to compel Defendant's attendance and testimony, set a firm deposition date, and impose **monetary sanctions under Code Civ. Proc. § 2025.450**---will be decided at the advanced hearing after full briefing on the shortened schedule. The Court retains full discretion to grant, deny, or tailor relief at that hearing.

* * * *

### V. REQUESTED ORDER / PROPOSED SCHEDULE

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:

1.  **Advance the hearing** on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel to **Thursday, December 4, 2025 at 9:00 a.m., Dept. R12** (or the Court's earliest convenient date);

2.  Set briefing as follows (or as the Court prefers):

    -   **Opposition due 5 court days before** the advanced hearing;

    -   **Reply due 2 court days before** the advanced hearing;

    -   Service by electronic means where permitted by statute, rule, or prior order; and

3.  Grant such further scheduling directions as may be necessary to effectuate the advanced hearing and ensure the Motion is heard sufficiently in advance of the July 13, 2026 trial date.

* * * *

### VI. CONCLUSION

Plaintiff has made the affirmative factual showing of **irreparable harm / immediate danger** required by **Cal. Rules of Court, rule 3.1202(c)** and has shown **good cause** under **CCP § 1005(b)** and **rule 3.1300(b)** for an order shortening time. Given Defendant's nonappearance at a duly noticed deposition, the closed discovery window, the approaching trial date, and the ongoing harms described in Plaintiff's declaration, ordinary noticed-motion timing is inadequate.

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court **grant an Order Shortening Time**, advance the hearing on the Motion as requested, and adopt the condensed briefing schedule set forth above.

Date: **November 12, 2025**

Respectfully submitted,
