Time: **9:00 a.m.**
Dept: **R12**

**Trial Date:** **July 13, 2026**

To the Court, the Clerk of the Court, and to Defendant **Megan Nicole Bentley** and her counsel of record:

Plaintiff **Michael James Romero** ("Plaintiff") hereby applies **ex parte** for an **Order Shortening Time** on **Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Cutoff** (the "Motion") and for a condensed briefing schedule. Plaintiff does **not** seek a merits ruling at the ex parte appearance; the merits of the Motion will be heard and decided at the advanced hearing.

**Relief Requested (CRC 3.1201(1), 3.1300(b); CCP § 1005(b)).**
Plaintiff moves ex parte for an order: (1) shortening time and **advancing the hearing** on Plaintiff's Motion (currently set for **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m.**) to the **earliest date available** to the Court **on or about Thursday, December 4, 2025**; and (2) setting a **condensed briefing schedule** (Opposition due **5 court days** before the advanced hearing; Reply due **2 court days** before), pursuant to **California Rules of Court ("CRC") 3.1200--3.1207 and 3.1300(b**, order shortening time) and **Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") § 1005(b)** (court may prescribe a shorter time). Good cause is shown in the concurrently filed **Declaration of Michael James Romero (Urgency)** and **Declaration re Notice**, which are expressly incorporated here by reference. 

This Application is made pursuant to **CRC 3.1200--3.1207** (ex parte rules), **CRC 3.1300(b)** (order shortening time), **CRC 3.1201** (required documents), **CRC 3.1202** (contents of application), and **CCP § 1005(b)** (notice period and court's power to shorten time), on the grounds set forth below, in the supporting declarations, and in the underlying Motion.

RELIEF REQUESTED (EX PARTE)
---------------------------

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court issue an order providing the following **limited scheduling relief**:

1.  **Order Shortening Time.** Advance the hearing on Plaintiff's **Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Cutoff** (currently set for **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m.**) to the **earliest date convenient for the Court on or about Thursday, December 4, 2025**, or such other date the Court selects.

2.  **Condensed Briefing Schedule.** Set the following deadlines (or such other deadlines as the Court deems appropriate):

    -   **Opposition** due **5 court days** before the advanced hearing date;

    -   **Reply** due **2 court days** before the advanced hearing date;

    -   Service may be effected by **electronic service** where permitted by statute, rule, or agreement of the parties.

3.  **Scope Clarification (No Merits Ruling Ex Parte).** Clarify that the Court will hear and decide the **merits** of:

    -   compelling Defendant's appearance for deposition and setting a firm date;

    -   Plaintiff's request for **monetary sanctions** under **CCP § 2025.450**; and

    -   Plaintiff's request for **limited leave to conduct post-cutoff discovery** under **CCP § 2024.050**;

    **at the advanced hearing on the Motion**, and **not** at the ex parte appearance.

4.  **Other Appropriate Relief.** Grant any additional scheduling or ancillary relief the Court deems just and proper to effectuate a timely hearing on the Motion.

* * * *

GROUNDS AND GOOD CAUSE
----------------------

1.  **Missed Party Deposition / No Protective Order.**
    Plaintiff duly noticed Defendant's deposition and, after receiving written objections, served an **amended deposition notice** that cured the technical objections (including providing a physical location and confirming remote oath administration). Despite this, **Defendant failed to appear** and did **not** seek a protective order or other relief. A certified shorthand reporter issued a **Certificate of Nonappearance**, and Plaintiff incurred approximately **$500** in court reporter charges and related costs. Under **CCP § 2025.450**, a party who fails to appear at a properly noticed deposition without obtaining a protective order may be subject to an order compelling attendance and **monetary sanctions**.

2.  **Discovery Cutoff Has Passed; Trial Date Is Firm.**
    The **general discovery cutoff elapsed on October 22, 2025**, while trial is set for **July 13, 2026**. Plaintiff seeks limited leave under **CCP § 2024.050** to complete **Defendant's deposition**, which is a central discovery event. The deposition of the party-opponent is essential to:

    -   evaluating liability and damages;

    -   preparing for trial (including witness examination and impeachment); and

    -   considering any necessary dispositive or evidentiary motions.

    Without a timely hearing and order on the Motion, Plaintiff will be effectively deprived of this critical discovery tool.

3.  **Calendar Congestion and Prejudice Without OST.**
    The Motion is currently set for hearing on **February 11, 2026**, nearly three months after filing and only several months before trial. Because the discovery cutoff has already passed, leaving the Motion on its ordinary schedule will:

    -   compress or foreclose Plaintiff's ability to take Defendant's deposition in an orderly fashion;

    -   jeopardize Plaintiff's ability to use deposition testimony for expert work, motion practice, and trial preparation; and

    -   risk **irreparable prejudice** to Plaintiff's ability to present his case fairly.

    Shortening time is necessary to avoid these prejudicial effects arising from the combination of **missed deposition**, **closed discovery**, and the current **crowded motion calendar**.

4.  **Ex Parte Standard Satisfied for Scheduling Relief Only.**
    Under **CRC 3.1300(b)** and **CCP § 1005(b)**, the Court may shorten the time for hearing and briefing of motions upon a showing of good cause in a supporting declaration.  **CRC 3.1202(c)** further requires an affirmative factual showing of **irreparable harm, immediate danger, or other statutory basis** for ex parte relief, which is supplied in Plaintiff's Declaration (Urgency).  

    Plaintiff is **not** seeking any **merits** determination ex parte; the requested relief is limited to scheduling and notice. The proposed briefing schedule (Opposition due 5 court days before the hearing; Reply due 2 court days before) preserves a fair opportunity for Defendant to oppose the Motion while permitting the Motion to be heard in time for its relief to be meaningful.

5.  **Irreparable Trial-Preparation Harm if Relief Is Denied.**
    If time is **not** shortened, Defendant's deposition may not occur sufficiently in advance of trial to allow:

    -   use of the transcript in **dispositive or evidentiary motions**;

    -   thorough **trial preparation** and witness impeachment planning; and

    -   informed **settlement evaluation** based on sworn testimony.

    These harms---lost opportunity to develop the evidentiary record and to prepare for trial---cannot be fully remedied **after the fact** and thus constitute **irreparable prejudice** under **CRC 3.1202(c)**.

PROCEDURAL POSTURE
------------------

-   **Underlying Motion Filed and Pending.**
    Plaintiff's **Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Cutoff** has been filed, served, and set for hearing on **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m.** in Department R12.

-   **Notice of Ex Parte Application (CRC 3.1203--3.1204).**  
    Plaintiff will provide ex parte notice to Defendant's counsel, **Randal P. Hannah, Esq. (Law Office of Randal P. Hannah), 489 N. Central Ave., Suite A, Upland, CA 91786, telephone (909) 608-1220, e-mail rhannah@rphannahlaw.com** by e-mail (and, if appropriate, telephone) stating the date, time, department, and courthouse for the ex parte appearance. Notice will be given no later than 10:00 a.m. -  **the court day before** the ex parte hearing, consistent with **CRC 3.1203(a)**.

    Plaintiff will **e-file** the ex parte papers and **serve them by e-mail** on defense counsel the same day. The department does **not** issue reservation numbers for ex parte calendars; **none was issued**.

-   **Local and State Rule Compliance (CRC 3.1205, 3.1206, 3.1207).**
    Plaintiff will:

    -   file and serve the ex parte papers within the time and manner required by **CRC 3.1205--3.1206** and any applicable local rules; and

    -   personally or remotely **appear in Department R12** on the scheduled ex parte date in accordance with **CRC 3.1207** (appearance requirements).

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES (SHORT FORM)
-------------------------------------------------

### A. Authority to Shorten Time

Under **CRC 3.1300(b)**, the Court may, on application supported by a declaration showing **good cause**, prescribe **shorter times** for filing and service of papers than those specified in **CCP § 1005**.   Section 1005(b) likewise authorizes the Court to **"prescribe a shorter time"** for hearing and briefing of motions.  

Because Plaintiff's Motion to Compel is already on calendar and supported by a separate moving and supporting papers, an **Order Shortening Time** is the appropriate procedural mechanism to ensure the Motion can be heard in a time frame that allows the requested relief to be meaningful.

### B. Ex Parte Standard and Narrow Relief Requested

The **ex parte rules (CRC 3.1200--3.1207)** govern this Application. They require written application, supporting declaration showing **irreparable harm or immediate danger**, a declaration regarding notice, and a proposed order. 

Here, Plaintiff seeks **only scheduling relief**---an advancement of the hearing date and a condensed briefing schedule---not an adjudication of the Motion's merits. This narrow relief is appropriate for ex parte treatment, provided that good cause and the requisite declarations are presented, which Plaintiff has done.

### C. Good Cause Shown in the Record and Supporting Declarations

Good cause exists where, as here:

-   A party **fails to appear** at a properly noticed deposition without seeking a protective order, justifying a motion to compel and sanctions under **CCP § 2025.450**;

-   **Discovery has closed**, and without post-cutoff leave under **CCP § 2024.050**, Plaintiff cannot complete essential party testimony; and

-   The court's calendar places the hearing **so late** that, absent an OST, Plaintiff's ability to use the deposition in **trial preparation and motion practice** will be materially impaired.

These facts, detailed in the **Declaration of Michael James Romero (Urgency)**, establish the **good cause and irreparable prejudice** required by **CRC 3.1202(c)** for ex parte scheduling relief while still allowing Defendant a fair opportunity to oppose the Motion on the merits.

The requested briefing schedule (Opposition 5 court days before hearing; Reply 2 court days before) tracks common practice for shortened-time motions and maintains due process protections for Defendant.
