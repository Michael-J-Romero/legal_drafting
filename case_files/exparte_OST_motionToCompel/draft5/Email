Dear Mr. Hannah:

Please be advised that on Thursday, November 13, 2025, at 9:00 a.m., in Department R12 of the Superior Court of California, County of San Bernardino, located at 8303 Haven Avenue, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730, Plaintiff Michael James Romero will appear ex parte for the following relief:

An Order Shortening Time on Plaintiff’s pending Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Cutoff, which is currently set for hearing on February 11, 2026, at 9:00 a.m. in Department R12;

An order setting a condensed briefing schedule on that motion; and

Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

The basis for the ex parte application includes, among other things, Defendant Megan Nicole Bentley’s failure to appear for her duly noticed deposition, the resulting need to compel her deposition and seek appropriate monetary sanctions, and the fact that the currently scheduled motion hearing date falls after key deadlines, including the discovery cutoff and the set trial date.

My ex parte appearance will be limited to this scheduling relief. I will not be seeking a merits ruling on the underlying motion at the ex parte hearing; the merits will be reserved for the advanced hearing date if the Court grants the application.

I am in the process of submitting the ex parte application, supporting memorandum, declarations, and proposed order to the Court. I will serve you with copies of the filed ex parte papers promptly in accordance with the applicable rules.

Please let me know whether you intend to appear and oppose the ex parte application and whether you plan to submit any written opposition. If you intend to appear remotely (if permitted by the Court and Department R12), please advise how you plan to appear so that I can inform the Court if appropriate.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Michael James Romero
Plaintiff, in Pro Per
