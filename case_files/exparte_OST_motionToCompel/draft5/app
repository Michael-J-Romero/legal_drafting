EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDER SHORTENING TIME ON PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT'S DEPOSITION; REQUEST FOR MONETARY SANCTIONS; REQUEST FOR LIMITED LEAVE AFTER DISCOVERY CUTOFF; AND FOR CONDENSED BRIEFING SCHEDULE; SUPPORTING DECLARATION AND PROPOSED ORDER
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Ex Parte Hearing:**
Date: **Thursday, November 13, 2025**
Time: **9:00 a.m.**
Dept: **R12**

**Trial Date:** **July 13, 2026**
**Discovery Cutoff:** **October 22, 2025**

To the Court, the Clerk of the Court, and to Defendant **Megan Nicole Bentley** and her counsel of record:

Plaintiff **Michael James Romero** ("Plaintiff") hereby applies ex parte for an **Order Shortening Time** on **Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Discovery Cutoff** (the "Motion"), and for a **condensed briefing schedule** on that Motion.

The ex parte relief sought is **strictly limited to scheduling**. Plaintiff does **not** ask the Court to decide the merits of the Motion, or to award any sanctions or other substantive relief, at the ex parte hearing. The merits of the Motion --- including Plaintiff's requests under **CCP § 2025.450** and **CCP § 2024.050** --- will be heard and decided at the advanced hearing on the Motion.

**Relief Requested (CRC 3.1201(1), 3.1300(b); CCP § 1005(b)).**
Plaintiff moves ex parte for an order:

1.  Shortening time and advancing the hearing on the Motion from its current setting of **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12** to the **earliest date convenient for the Court**;

2.  Setting a condensed briefing schedule on the Motion, with Opposition and Reply deadlines measured in court days before the advanced hearing date; and

3.  Confirming that the merits of the Motion (including the requests for monetary sanctions and for limited leave after the discovery cutoff) will be heard and decided **only at the advanced hearing on the regularly noticed Motion**, not at this ex parte appearance.

This Application is made pursuant to **CRC 3.1200--3.1207** (ex parte rules), **CRC 3.1300(b)** (order shortening time), and **CCP § 1005(b)** (notice period and court's power to shorten time), on the grounds that: (a) Defendant failed to appear for her properly noticed deposition without obtaining a protective order; (b) the **general discovery cutoff has now passed** while Defendant's deposition remains outstanding; (c) the case has a firm **trial date of July 13, 2026**; and (d) the Court's ordinary law and motion calendar currently sets the Motion on **February 11, 2026**, which will effectively deprive Plaintiff of a fair opportunity to obtain and use Defendant's deposition testimony in discovery, expert preparation, motion practice, and trial.

Good cause is shown in the concurrently filed **Declaration of Michael James Romero (in Support of Ex Parte Application for Order Shortening Time)** and **Declaration of Michael James Romero Regarding Ex Parte Notice**, which are expressly incorporated here by reference.

PROCEDURAL POSTURE
------------------

-   **Underlying Motion Filed and Pending.**
    Plaintiff's **Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Discovery Cutoff** has been filed and is presently set for hearing on **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12**. The Motion seeks an order compelling Defendant's deposition, monetary sanctions under **CCP § 2025.450**, and limited leave under **CCP § 2024.050** to complete Defendant's deposition after the discovery cutoff.

-   **Discovery Cutoff and Trial Setting.**
    The **general discovery cutoff elapsed on October 22, 2025**, and the case is set for a firm **jury trial on July 13, 2026**. Absent timely completion of Defendant's deposition, Plaintiff cannot fairly prepare for expert discovery, pretrial motions, or trial.

-   **Notice of Ex Parte Application (CRC 3.1203--3.1204).**
    On **November 10, 2025**, at approximately **2:35 p.m. Pacific Time**, Plaintiff provided ex parte notice of this Application **by email** to Defendant's counsel, **Randal P. Hannah, Esq.**, at **rhannah@rphannahlaw.com** - advising counsel that Plaintiff would appear ex parte on **November 13, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. in Department R12** at the courthouse located at **8303 Haven Avenue, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730**, to seek an **Order Shortening Time on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Discovery Cutoff**, and briefly describing the grounds and relief requested. As of **8:00 p.m. on November 12, 2025**, Plaintiff had **not received any response** from Defendant's counsel and therefore does **not know** whether Defendant intends to oppose this ex parte Application. These facts are set forth in more detail in Plaintiff's **Declaration Regarding Ex Parte Notice**.

    Plaintiff will **e-file** the ex parte papers and **serve them on Defendant's counsel** in accordance with the Rules of Court and any applicable local rules. Plaintiff understands that the Court does not issue reservation numbers for ex parte calendars; none has been issued.

-   **Local and State Rule Compliance (CRC 3.1205, 3.1206, 3.1207).**
    Plaintiff will:

    -   file and serve the ex parte papers within the time and in the manner prescribed by **CRC 3.1205--3.1206** and any applicable local rules; and

    -   personally appear (or appear as otherwise permitted by the Court) for the ex parte hearing in compliance with **CRC 3.1207** and all applicable local procedures.

* * * *

GROUNDS AND GOOD CAUSE
----------------------

1.  **Missed Party Deposition / No Protective Order.**
    Plaintiff duly noticed Defendant's deposition and, after reasonable accommodations and rescheduling, set a deposition date. Despite this, **Defendant failed to appear** and did **not** seek or obtain a protective order. Plaintiff incurred approximately **$500** in court reporter charges and related costs for the nonappearance and remains without Defendant's sworn testimony. Under **CCP § 2025.450**, a party who fails to appear for a properly noticed deposition without obtaining a protective order may be subject to an order compelling attendance and **monetary sanctions**. The Motion is the procedural vehicle by which Plaintiff seeks that relief.

2.  **Discovery Cutoff Has Passed; Trial Date Is Firm.**
    The **general discovery cutoff passed on October 22, 2025** while Defendant's deposition remained outstanding. The case is set for a firm **trial on July 13, 2026**. Without Defendant's deposition, Plaintiff cannot adequately prepare for expert examinations, dispositive or evidentiary motions, or trial itself. Plaintiff therefore seeks limited leave under **CCP § 2024.050** to complete **Defendant's deposition** after the cutoff, as specifically requested in the Motion.

3.  **Crowded Motion Calendar; Prejudice Without OST.**
    The Court's ordinary law and motion calendar has placed the Motion on **February 11, 2026**, well after the discovery cutoff and significantly closer to trial. Leaving the Motion on that schedule will:

    -   compress or foreclose Plaintiff's ability to take Defendant's deposition in an orderly fashion;

    -   jeopardize Plaintiff's ability to use Defendant's testimony for expert work, motion practice, and trial preparation; and

    -   risk **irreparable prejudice** to Plaintiff's ability to present his case fairly at the July 13, 2026 trial.

    Shortening time is necessary to avoid these prejudicial effects and to reconcile the **missed deposition**, the **elapsed discovery cutoff**, and the **crowded motion calendar**.

4.  **Ex Parte Standard Satisfied for Scheduling Relief Only.**
    Under **CRC 3.1300(b)** and **CCP § 1005(b)**, the Court may, on a proper showing, prescribe a shorter time for the hearing and briefing of motions. **CRC 3.1200--3.1207** governs ex parte applications and recognizes that good cause for ex parte relief can be shown where a party faces irreparable harm or immediate danger if relief is delayed, or where the requested relief is of a **purely scheduling** character.

    Here, Plaintiff seeks **only** an order shortening time and a condensed briefing schedule, so that the **already-filed and already-noticed Motion** may be heard on an advanced date. Plaintiff does **not** seek to have the Motion decided ex parte. The limited scheduling relief requested aligns with **CRC 3.1202(c)** for ex parte scheduling orders and with the Court's inherent authority to manage its calendar.

* * * *

RELIEF REQUESTED (EX PARTE)
---------------------------

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court issue an order providing the following **limited scheduling relief**:

1.  **Order Shortening Time.**
    Advance the hearing on Plaintiff's **Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Discovery Cutoff** from **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12** to the **earliest date convenient for the Court**, with the understanding that the merits of the Motion --- including Plaintiff's requests under **CCP § 2025.450** and **§ 2024.050** --- will be heard and decided **only at that advanced hearing**, not at the ex parte appearance.

2.  **Condensed Briefing Schedule.**
    Set the following deadlines (or such other deadlines as the Court deems appropriate) for briefing on the Motion:

    -   **Opposition** to be filed and served **5 court days before** the advanced hearing date;

    -   **Reply** to be filed and served **2 court days before** the advanced hearing date.

3.  **Other Appropriate Scheduling Relief.**
    Grant any additional scheduling or procedural relief that the Court deems just and proper to effectuate a timely hearing on the Motion, while preserving the parties' due process rights and the Court's orderly administration of its calendar.

* * * *

PRAYER
------

For the reasons set forth above, in the supporting declarations, in Plaintiff's concurrently filed **Declaration Regarding Ex Parte Notice**, and in the underlying Motion, Plaintiff respectfully prays that the Court:

1.  Issue an **Order Shortening Time** advancing the hearing on Plaintiff's Motion from **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12** to the **earliest date convenient for the Court**;

2.  Set a **condensed briefing schedule** on the Motion, with Opposition due **5 court days** and Reply due **2 court days** before the advanced hearing date (or such other schedule as the Court deems just and proper); and

3.  Grant such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
