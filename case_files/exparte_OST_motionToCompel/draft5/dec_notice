I, **Michael James Romero**, declare:

1.  **Identity and Purpose of Declaration.**
    I am the Plaintiff in this action. I make this declaration in support of my **Ex Parte Application for Order Shortening Time on Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Discovery Cutoff; and for Condensed Briefing Schedule**. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this declaration and, if called as a witness, could and would competently testify thereto.

2.  **Ex Parte Hearing Information.**
    The ex parte application is set for hearing on **Thursday, November 13, 2025 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12** of the Superior Court of California, County of San Bernardino, Rancho Cucamonga District, located at **8303 Haven Avenue, Rancho Cucamonga, California 91730**.

3.  **Nature of Relief Sought Ex Parte.**
    The ex parte application seeks **strictly limited scheduling relief**. I am asking the Court to:

    -   issue an **Order Shortening Time** on **Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Discovery Cutoff** (the Motion), which is presently set for hearing on **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12**; and

    -   set a **condensed briefing schedule** on that Motion.

    I am **not** asking the Court to decide the merits of the Motion, to order Defendant's deposition, or to award sanctions at the ex parte hearing. All issues concerning the merits of the Motion are reserved for the advanced hearing on the regularly noticed Motion.

4.  **Opposing Counsel Information.**
    Defendant **Megan Nicole Bentley** is represented by:

    **Randal P. Hannah, Esq.**
    Law Office of Randal P. Hannah
    489 N. Central Ave., Suite A
    Upland, CA 91786
    Email: **rhannah@rphannahlaw.com**

5.  **Ex Parte Notice to Opposing Counsel.**
    On **Monday, November 10, 2025**, at approximately **2:35 p.m. Pacific Time**, I provided ex parte notice of this application to **Randal P. Hannah, Esq.** **by email** at **rhannah@rphannahlaw.com**, using the contact information that has been used for communications in this case.

    In that notice, I advised Defendant's counsel of:

    -   the **date, time, and department** of the ex parte hearing (**November 13, 2025, at 9:00 a.m., Dept. R12**);

    -   the **nature of the relief** requested (an order shortening time on the Motion and a condensed briefing schedule);

    -   the **grounds** for the request, including Defendant's missed deposition, the discovery cutoff having passed while Defendant's deposition remains outstanding, the current hearing date of **February 11, 2026** on the Motion, and the **July 13, 2026** trial date; and

    -   the fact that I am **not** seeking a ruling on the merits of the Motion or sanctions at the ex parte hearing, but only scheduling relief.

    This notice was provided more than one court day before the ex parte hearing.

6.  **Content of Notice and Opportunity to Respond.**
    In giving notice, I informed Defendant's counsel that the Court may proceed with the ex parte application whether or not Defendant appears, and that the Court may advance the hearing on the Motion and set a briefing schedule even if Defendant does not appear at the ex parte hearing. I gave Defendant's counsel a reasonable opportunity to indicate whether he intended to appear or oppose the application and to respond to my notice before the hearing.

7.  **Opposition Status (CRC 3.1204).**
    After sending the notice described above, and as of **8:00 p.m. on November 12, 2025**, I had **not received any response** from Defendant's counsel to my ex parte notice email. Defendant's counsel has **not stated** whether Defendant intends to oppose this ex parte application. Based on this, **opposition is unknown at this time**. I will advise the Court at the ex parte hearing of any updated information regarding opposition.

8.  **Service and Filing of Ex Parte Papers.**
    In addition to providing advance notice as described above, I am causing the ex parte application, supporting declarations, and proposed order to be **electronically filed with the Court** and **served on Defendant's counsel** in accordance with the California Rules of Court and any applicable local rules. Service includes the methods ordinarily used between the parties in this case and is reasonably calculated to give Defendant's counsel actual notice of the ex parte application and supporting papers in advance of the hearing.

9.  **Compliance with California Rules of Court, Rules 3.1203--3.1204.**
    This declaration is intended to comply with **California Rules of Court, rules 3.1203 and 3.1204**, including the requirements that I:

    -   identify opposing counsel and the party represented;

    -   describe **when and how** notice of the ex parte application was given;

    -   state the **relief** being requested and the **grounds** for the request that were communicated to opposing counsel; and

    -   state whether opposing counsel has taken a position or indicated whether opposition may be expected.

True and correct copies of any proof(s) of service relating to the ex parte papers are attached as **Exhibit B**.
