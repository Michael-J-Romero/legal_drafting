# SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

# COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO

**Michael James Romero,**
Plaintiff,

v.

**Megan Nicole Bentley,**
Defendant.

Case No.: **CIVRS2501874**
Assigned Judge: **Hon. Kory Mathewson**
Dept: **R12**
Location: **8303 Haven Avenue, Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730**

## EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDER SHORTENING TIME ON PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL DEFENDANT’S DEPOSITION; REQUEST TO SET CONDENSED BRIEFING SCHEDULE; SUPPORTING DECLARATION AND [PROPOSED] ORDER

**Ex Parte Hearing:**
Date: **Thursday, November 13, 2025**
Time: **9:00 a.m.**
Dept: **R12**

**Trial Date:** **July 13, 2026**
**Discovery Cutoff:** **October 22, 2025**

To the Court, the Clerk of the Court, and to Defendant **Megan Nicole Bentley** and her counsel of record:

Plaintiff **Michael James Romero** applies **ex parte** for an **Order Shortening Time (OST)** to advance the hearing on **Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Cutoff** (the “Motion”) and to set a condensed briefing schedule. Plaintiff does **not** seek merits relief at the ex parte appearance; the merits will be decided at the advanced hearing.

This Application is brought pursuant to **California Rules of Court (CRC) 3.1300(b)** (good cause to shorten time) and **CRC 3.1200–3.1207** (ex parte procedures), and **Code of Civil Procedure (CCP) § 1005(b)** (default motion notice period), on the grounds set forth below and in the concurrently filed declarations and memorandum.

## RELIEF REQUESTED (EX PARTE)

1. **Order Shortening Time:** Advance the hearing on Plaintiff’s **Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Cutoff** (currently set for **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m.**) to the earliest date convenient for the Court **on or about Thursday, December 4, 2025**.

2. **Condensed Briefing Schedule:** Set the following (or such other) deadlines:
   • **Opposition** due **5 court days** before the advanced hearing;
   • **Reply** due **2 court days** before the advanced hearing;
   • Service may be effected by electronic service where permitted.

3. **Scope Clarification:** The Court will hear and decide the **merits** of compelling attendance, setting a firm deposition date, monetary sanctions under **CCP § 2025.450**, and limited leave under **CCP § 2024.050** **at the advanced hearing**, not at the ex parte appearance.

4. **Other Appropriate Relief:** Any further scheduling or ancillary relief the Court deems just to effectuate the advanced hearing.

## GROUNDS AND GOOD CAUSE

1. **Missed Party Deposition / No Protective Order.** Plaintiff duly noticed Defendant’s deposition and, after receiving written objections, served an amended notice that cured technical objections (including providing a physical address and confirming remote oath administration). **Defendant failed to appear** and did **not** obtain a protective order. A certified shorthand reporter issued a **Certificate of Nonappearance** and Plaintiff incurred **$500** in charges.

2. **Discovery Cutoff Has Passed; Trial Is Set.** The **discovery cutoff elapsed on October 22, 2025**. Trial is set for **July 13, 2026**. The deposition of a party-opponent is **central** to the prosecution of this case and to pretrial tasks (e.g., trial prep; potential motions).

3. **Calendar Congestion Requires OST for Fair Adjudication.** The Motion is presently noticed for **February 11, 2026**, approximately three months after filing. Without an OST, Plaintiff risks compressed or foreclosed opportunities to obtain and use Defendant’s testimony in the ordinary course of pretrial preparation.

4. **Ex Parte Standard Satisfied for Scheduling Relief.** Good cause exists to shorten time under **CRC 3.1300(b)**. Plaintiff is **not** seeking a merits ruling ex parte; the narrow relief requested is a scheduling adjustment to ensure the Motion can be heard with fair but expedited briefing.

## PROCEDURAL POSTURE

* **Underlying Motion Filed and Pending.** Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant’s Deposition (with requests for sanctions and limited post-cutoff leave) has been filed and set on calendar.
* **Notice of Ex Parte.** Plaintiff will provide ex parte notice to Defendant’s counsel, **Randal P. Hannah, Esq. (Law Office of Randal P. Hannah), 489 N. Central Ave., Upland, CA 91786**, **by email**, stating the **date, time, department, and courthouse** for the ex parte appearance. The notice will be provided no later than **10:00 a.m. the court day before** the hearing. Plaintiff will **e‑file** the ex parte papers and **serve them by email** on defense counsel the same day. The department does **not** issue reservation numbers for ex parte calendars; **none was issued**.
* **Local and State Rule Compliance.** Plaintiff will file and serve the ex parte papers by the department’s deadline and appears in accordance with **CRC 3.1207**.

## MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES (SHORT FORM)

**A. Authority to Shorten Time.** The Court may, for good cause, shorten time for the hearing of a motion. (**CRC 3.1300(b)**; **CCP § 1005(b)**.)

**B. Ex Parte Standard and Narrow Relief.** Ex parte relief is proper for scheduling adjustments upon a showing of immediate need or good cause; the merits will be adjudicated on the noticed motion at the advanced hearing. (**CRC 3.1200–3.1207**.)

**C. Good Cause Shown Here.** Defendant’s **nonappearance** at a properly noticed deposition (without seeking a protective order), the **closed discovery** window, and the **centrality** of party testimony to trial preparation establish good cause to accelerate the hearing while preserving a fair opportunity to brief and oppose. The requested schedule (opposition 5 court days before; reply 2 court days before) balances expedition with due process.

Date: **November 12, 2025**

Respectfully submitted,
