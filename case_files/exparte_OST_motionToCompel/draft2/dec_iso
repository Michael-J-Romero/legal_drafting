## DECLARATION OF MICHAEL JAMES ROMERO

### IN SUPPORT OF EX PARTE APPLICATION FOR ORDER SHORTENING TIME

I, **Michael James Romero**, declare:

1. **Identity and Capacity.** I am the Plaintiff in this action, appearing in pro per. I have personal knowledge of the facts set forth herein and, if called as a witness, could and would competently testify thereto.

2. **Underlying Motion on File and Set.** I filed **Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Defendant's Deposition; Request for Monetary Sanctions; and Request for Limited Leave After Cutoff** (the "Motion"), which is set for **February 11, 2026 at 9:00 a.m. in Dept. R12**. A true and correct copy of the **Notice of Motion** and hearing setting is attached as **Exhibit D**.

3. **Deposition Notice and Amendments.** I duly noticed Defendant **Megan Nicole Bentley's** deposition and, after receiving written objections, served an amended notice that cured the objections (including providing a physical address and confirming remote oath administration). True and correct copies of the deposition notice(s), objections, amended notice, and proof(s) of service are attached as **Exhibit B**.

4. **Nonappearance / Certificate of Nonappearance.** Defendant did not appear for her deposition and did not seek or obtain any protective order. A certified shorthand reporter issued a **Certificate of Nonappearance**, and I incurred **$500** in reporter fees and related costs. A true and correct copy of the Certificate is attached as **Exhibit A**.

5. **Meet and Confer Efforts.** Following the nonappearance, I met and conferred with Defendant (and/or her counsel) by email and telephone in an effort to promptly reschedule the deposition without court intervention. Those efforts were unsuccessful. True and correct copies of my correspondence are attached as **Exhibit C**.

6. **Discovery Status and Trial Setting.** The **discovery cutoff has passed on October 22, 2025**. Trial is presently set for **July 13, 2026**. As a party-opponent, Defendant's sworn testimony is **central** to the claims and defenses and necessary for orderly completion of pretrial tasks (including deposition-based impeachment, witness and exhibit designations, and trial readiness). Waiting until **February 11, 2026** to hear the Motion will **materially compress** the time to obtain and use Defendant's testimony.

7. **Good Cause for Shortened Time.** I am **not** seeking merits relief at the ex parte appearance. I seek **only an Order Shortening Time** so that the already-filed Motion can be heard on the Court's earliest available date, with a fair but condensed schedule (Opposition due **5 court days** before; Reply due **2 court days** before). Good cause exists because: (a) Defendant failed to appear for a properly noticed deposition and did not pursue a protective order; (b) discovery is closed; (c) the party deposition is pivotal to trial preparation; and (d) the current three-month delay to hearing risks prejudice that an earlier hearing would avoid.

8. **Ex Parte Notice (CRC 3.1203/3.1204).** On **[DATE]** at **[TIME]**, I will provide ex parte notice **by email** to **Defendant's counsel, Randal P. Hannah, Esq. (Law Office of Randal P. Hannah), 489 N. Central Ave., Upland, CA 91786**, stating that I will appear **ex parte** in **Dept. R12** on **Thursday, November 13, 2025 at 9:00 a.m.** to request an **Order Shortening Time** on the Motion and a condensed briefing schedule; that I will **not** seek a merits ruling ex parte; and asking whether opposition is anticipated. I will **e-file** the ex parte papers and **serve them by email** on defense counsel the same day. A true and correct copy of my notice (and any response) will be attached as **Exhibit E**.

9. **Proposed Schedule.** If the Court grants this Application, I respectfully propose: (a) set the Motion for hearing on **Thursday, December 4, 2025**; (b) require any Opposition **5 court days** before hearing; (c) allow a Reply **2 court days** before hearing; and (d) permit electronic service where authorized.

10. **Attachments Incorporated.** This declaration incorporates by reference the papers already on file with the Court in support of the Motion and attaches true and correct copies of Exhibits A–E as described above, lodged concurrently.

11. **Reservation of Merits for Advanced Hearing.** All merits issues—compelling attendance, setting a firm deposition date, monetary sanctions under **CCP § 2025.450**, and limited leave under **CCP § 2024.050**—are reserved for the advanced hearing on the Motion.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on **November 12, 2025**, at **Los Angeles, California**.
